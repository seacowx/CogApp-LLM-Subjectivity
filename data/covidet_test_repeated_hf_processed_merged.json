        "situation": "I dont even know how to speak of this grief. I have read of many stories of people losing their loved ones, but it didnt happen to my family until today. I lost my uncle who is my best friend, we lived abroad all our lives but because of the pandemic I returned home, and barely managed to see him those 2 years. He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination. I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live. I dont know what or how to live life without him in my mind, without meeting him ever again, with seeing the same places without him. Im tired, I want to cry. We both hated living at home now I am stuck living on earth without him, I feel this home is the right place for me - was waiting eagerly for him to return. But he barely lasted a week before his death. But mentally I am exhausted of living here, of the pandemic, of having my friends all abroad and getting out of contact, of being alone to face his death. To face this life. Life feels so tasteless.",

I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it.

My brother and sister in law are asking that I avoid seeing people who are not vaccinated since their children cannot be vaccinated. Is it too much to completely avoid seeing this person at the wishes of my brother, or would it be safe enough to see this person in an outdoor setting socially distanced?

        "situation": "I have hashimotos disease, diagnosed when I was 17, now 24. Every health professional that Ive seen regarding it hasnt seemed to think its that much of a big deal as Im medicated and blood work looks fine, but I will be on meds for it for the rest of my life. I dont trust what these health professionals are telling me because they all seem to have different opinions and some have willingly admitted that they dont know enough about autoimmune diseases. Ive been told that Im not at any greater risk of getting covid because of my disease, but have read differently. Im concerned about getting the vaccine because Ive heard from another doctor that its linked to autoimmune responses, but I cant find much online about the matter and Im afraid that if I dont get the vaccine, Ill be putting myself at greater risk. However, Im also afraid that the vaccine will cause further autoimmune problems, as the disease I already have is already a lot to deal with especially when I cant find a health professional that knows enough about it to help me. Im hoping someone here might be able to drop some knowledge?",

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.",

After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time. Does what I describe track with anyone's experience? I wonder for how long I'll be unable to exercise without precipitating unwanted flare-ups of Covid symptoms or Covid vaccine side effects.",

I was waiting for this so long, and now I'm just... mildly disappointed. right now situation in my country is more or less okay, but I am still WFH, and my office sent us official info that we can start coming back to the office only since September. so I'm still gonna be stuck at home over the summer. then also I am worried that September return to the office won't happen because everyone is scaring is that we will have another wave in the autumn. so literally what is the point? the only consolation I have is that I am being responsible, and I'm not contributing to the situation potentially getting worse again. I want to feel happier about it or more relieved. tbh I have no energy for this anymore. cool now I can rot in depression inside my apartment while being fully vaccinated.",

As of right now we have not been seeing many case increases here in the US. The occasional rise, but so far it hasn't been huge. That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone. THAT'S the motivation I should have. Yes, we still have to be vigilant and yes, we DO have more to vaccinate, but things are just so much better now than before. And for that, I personally think we should stay hopeful, not fearful. This is probably the best I can give to others who feel similar worries.",

Were about to face the worst wave yet. Hospital beds are already over-demanded, and well, Im terrified, seeing as weve had a massively inefficient vaccine rollout which just so happens to have widely employed the one vaccine that provides less protection (being the J&amp;J). For anyone who reminded me two days ago not to be depressed, dont worry, I spoke to my therapist and then this shit happened. I rarely see people anymore, but Im petrified. Ive had a couple small interactions and people arent being careful. Theyve given up. Id go full hermit but my partner is required to go to work in person some days of the week. Im breaking inside.

        "situation": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.",

I decided not to get the second shot with my doctor's support, because I've been so unwell that they say my body needs a break. I was hospitalized for a rapid heartbeat and chest pain 2 weeks ago which I was told is pleurisy. The pain has only gotten worse, but the doctor told me that it will eventually go away. I can't drive anymore because I don't have the strength in my arms to navigate the steering wheel. I can't even pick up a water glass with one hand. I sleep 3 or 4 hours a nite because the pain keeps waking me up. I made the tough decision today to withdraw from school this term because I just feel so delirious a lot of the time now that my brain can't do it. These physical and mental effects are just making me feel pretty bummed out and sad. I know that I'm lucky to not have it as bad as many other people during these Covid times. But I feel really alone in this, as everyone around me is getting vaccinated and going out and enjoying life, right as I'm getting so sick and homebound. I have faith that this will get better, I'm just having a hard time accepting that I need to put my life on hold until it does. Support, kind words, anything, much appreciated. And to add again - please get vaccinated! My experience is very rare and everyone I know had minimal side effects, if any. That's part of what's making me feel so alone in this!",

However, the masks are a nightmare for me personally. They trigger off my migraines, I could hardly concentrate at school because of it. I also have a sensory disability, which makes wearing masks 10 times harder. Everything is brighter, louder, and everything feels more crowded when I wear them. Its horrible. And it looks like we have to wear them for the next school year, and its my final year. I cant risk it. So I want to know if any you know where I can get masks that are migraine/sensory friendly? While still doing the job a normal medical mask does. Thanks.",

I've tried pouring my heart and soul into figuring things out but no matter how much I debunk it feels like there's always more shit that could come out. I feel like the only 'right' thing to do is ignore it and pretend I'm okay because anything else would be making things worse for the rest of my family. I know that she cares about me but I feel so fucking helpless. I hope full approval comes soon so that might convince her but I don't know how long that will be. I feel depressed and miserable. Covid itself was bearable enough but my own mom being lied to and deceived with this shit makes me wish I didn't have to live through this. If I could've spent two years in a coma and missed all of this I'd probably be happier overall. I don't know what I could say or what to do to get her to understand. I feel like I'm breaking down.",
