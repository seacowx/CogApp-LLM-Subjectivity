We WILL get him vaccinated, but I've been told to hold off, as he could have severe side effects if too soon. But I've also heard it all: do it right away, wait ninety days, wait six months to a year. With Delta now a problem, I want to do it soon. I signed him up to get his first jab on July 9 because I want him fully vaccinated before a trip in August, but I'm nervous about it. Anyone been vaccinated shortly after covid or have any advice?

No more mandatory testing at work place. Govt. now pays testing sites less. Yeah, there is an election coming up in October, so the populists decided to implement populist measures. The worst thing? About 15% of my fellowcitizens vote for parties whose leaders believe in nanochips in vaccines, chemtrails and \"doctors are killing people on purpose\". I am among the 30% of fully vaccinated people and I am not ready for ending up in lockdown because of people who will not take the vaccine, because they are worried about Bill Gates' nanochips or feel it is some sort of rebelion. Today a big upset about Croatia not letting unvaccinated and untested people in. Not the fact we are entering fifth wave. Apparently vaccationing on shitty concrete beach is more important (not staying all Croatia sucks, it's just Czechs manage to find the most unappealing places in any country to flock there. Same with Bibione, Italy.) It just seems we will not get out of the mess. Too many people are far gone.

        "situation": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.",

However, I've read a couple of articles about how the fourth wave may come (mainly because of the Delta variant and UEFA cup), about the spike of cases in the UK, etc. Is it just another pathetic attempt of fearmongering, which media can't catch a break from, or should I really be worried about another lockdown coming in fall? This winter was absolutely terrible and miserable and I'd rather enter the cage full of rabid hungry dogs that go through it again tbh.",

Im more nervous about the restrictions that come with these surges and that if a big surge happens colleges will switch to online learning which i really dont want to happen since I miss my friends in my college state. I was feeling so much better mentally weeks ago and felt super optimistic because of low numbers and I feel like this delta variant has just put a wrench in that. I know that since Im fully vaccinated I dont need to worry a whole lot about it but I just dont want to see a repeat of 100,000 cases a day and different restrictions. I just want these variants to stop because it seems like everytime Im semi happy a new one makes a surprise and turns out to be more contagious. Anyways thanks for reading this rant",

For items that need refrigeration or are too big to fit in the quarantine area I wipe it down with disinfectant. I was recently mentioning this to a friend who told me that this was overkill since apparently new research has shown it is not needed. Is this true? The friend also sides with the CDC over WHO regarding mask usage for vaccinated people so I'm apprehensive to listen to them. If there is research along these lines then I it saying it is not possible to spread through groceries/deliveries or that it is simply a lower chance. If it matters, I'm fully vaccinated with Pfizer. But still nervous about delta strain and also still don't want to get any covid even if the shirt term effects are minimal due to the vaccine (if I understand correctly the long term effects of getting covid after the vaccine have not been confirmed)?

The UK is full of Delta and the borders are heavily restricted. 10 days of mandatory quarantine plus an expensive mandatory \"test package\" which I cannot afford. Very few countries are exempt from this, almost entirely small islands around the world. Meanwhile Denmark's infection numbers have doubled, yay European football events. So the hopes of ever getting on the UK's green list are smaller and smaller. I have since the start of this whole thing been worrying about loved ones. First my elderly grandparents for being high risk, then my best friend who had her baby very premature, then my mum was bedridden for months due to covid, and now my dad has cancer and has to have chemo. It has been almost a full year since I saw a single family member, more than a year for many of them. And not even a glimmer of hope. I am fully vaccinated even, and I am watching people here happy about losing restrictions, but I am so scared of losing someone after being away for so long and it's getting more and more overwhelming. I know nobody can say magic words to fix things, I just really needed to vent about how it's July 2021 and this is still ongoing for the foreseeable future.",

        "situation": "Does anyone have any advice on best ways to deal with pretty bad anxiety while living alone and working from home? FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that. TLDR; Any tips as to how to get out of my head and regain that sense of safety to be alone again after suffering anxiety because of the pandemic?",

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience? What did you end up doing? If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy",

That we dont know the long term effects. But I got it anyway. And now Im starting to think about it more. Ive always been a hypochondriac. And lately, Ive been aware of my heartbeat. When Im resting, I can feel it in my chest by itself. I remember reading an article about teens having heart problems or palpitations after getting the vaccine. And now Im worried that Im one of those people. But I also dont know if it could be other things. Maybe its because Im inactive. Or how I eat. I dont know. Im getting my 2nd vaccine shot on Friday. But if my heart thing is vaccine related, wont it get worse? Im scared. You cant unvaccinate yourself. If I get my second and it gives me heart problems the rest of my life, Im screwed. I survived covid once. What if I made a mistake? I dont know anymore. Im scared of both things. I hate being a hypochondriac.",

If it is, then please suggest a better place to post it (in this thread, or in a PM, or via whatever form of communication suits you. Regarding the mask. I say \"covid filtration efficiency\" because I'm not exactly sure what I should be looking for. I assume I should be looking at \"viral filtration efficiency\" scores/tests but for what particle size? I seem to recall hearing that your typical covid aerosol is about 0.3 micrometers in diameter but I could definitely be wrong about that. I'm guessing I can simply close off a valve with some kind of solid object, but I'm not sure. Certainly, I want to avoid risking spreading the virus to others in the case that I become infected (I suppose one might argue that with properly wearing a very protective mask I am unlikely to be infected in the first place. Don't ask me about the legitimacy of that argument though) The goal here is to get a mask with a high degree of protection against covid. My mother is aged and smokes a lot and my country is in the middle of a covid delta variant spike so I need a high degree of protection. Whether I'm severely paranoid or otherwise, 95% filtration efficiency is not enough to satisfy me. You have my thanks in advance for your assistance, and my apologies for any imposition.",

This pandemic has given me pretty bad health anxiety, and I still feel super uncomfortable being indoors with such a large group (100-150 people), especially since I live in an area where vaccination rates are under 50% and very few people wear masks (even unvaccinated). I know for sure there will be people at the wedding who are unvaccinated and unmasked. I also got the J&amp;J vaccine, and its effectiveness against delta seems somewhat unclear. Im debating whether or not I can even attend because just the thought of being inside with that many people unmasked (and some unvaccinated) gives me extreme anxiety.

Before I got vaccinated, I was in constant in fear of dying, spreading it to someone high risk, or my family getting sick/dying. My immediate family knows that I suffer with it, but no one aside from my brother really understands the levity of how crippling it can be. I barely leave the house cuz of it now and have to put ointment on my skin because I've been oversanitizing/overwashing to the point where my skin bleeds and cracks. My immediate family isn't against COVID safety by any means, but they definitely make me feel crazy for still wanting to disinfect everything and everything else. The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID. They're now all fully vaccinated, but I'm extremely anxious to be around them and that some freak outbreak could happen between us. I'm trying to set boundaries and minimize exposure, but knowing my family, feeling the weight of their judgment will also give me immense anxiety. Part of me doesn't want to really go to this family event, but my mom keeps reassuring me that it's only our family and no one else (even though that's like 30 people). I also have a rocky relationship with religion due to being queer so being in a church setting to begin with is really hard for me. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop spiraling and calming myself down around everyone? Will having these spiraling thoughts about COVID hurting my loved ones and I ever going to end?",

There will probably be 50ish guests there (don't know exactly, could be more). It is planned to be a garden party but forecast says rain, so it's probably indoors. It's in my hometown, so I would need to travel there a few hours to attend. I haven't seen many of the people attending there since last year including some of my friends. Mainly because I didn't want to meet because of the virus. I only texted with them. Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(Moderna). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite. Like I have the caveman syndrome when it comes to larger groups. How do you evaluate the situation? I guess I just need some opinions on it. Thanks for reading so far!:)",

It just feels like we will never get normality back. COVID has completely ruined me. I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. &amp;#x200B; I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. &amp;#x200B; We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? &amp;#x200B; I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news. If the vaccines aren't enough for getting us out of this shit, what will be???? I just don't feel like life is worth living anymore under these restrictions. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for being negative, I just needed to rant.",

        "situation": "Hey guys, Apologies- pessimistic post incoming- feel free to delete if inappropriate. I'm struggling so much at the moment with having any sort of hope for the future. It just feels like we will never get normality back. COVID has completely ruined me. I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news. If the vaccines aren't enough for getting us out of this shit, what will be???? I just don't feel like life is worth living anymore under these restrictions. Sorry for being negative, I just needed to rant.",

I struggle with severe food allergies and therefore getting the first dose of the vaccine was incredibly difficult for me. I feared having a severe allergic reaction and had many panic attacks leading up to the vaccine appointment. Luckily, all went well and Im not anticipating my second dose. However, I have a few fears. First, I developed an odd skin reaction approximately one week after vaccination. My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts. Not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but I cant think of anything else If this was due to the vaccine, does that put me at any risk of having a severe allergic reaction with the second dose? Second, I am a woman in my early twenties. Ive heard reports of myocarditis after the second dose in young people. This is quite scary to me as Im very active. Should I be concerned? Thanks everyone.",

I live in Italy and here we had three lockdowns, the last one ending around May. They left me absolutely burnt out. Sometimes I just feel like I'm in a different universe than I was in two years ago and nothing makes sense anymore. A lot of nice things are happening to me: I am graduating on Monday, I got my vaccine and maybe my boyfriend will finally be able to come visit after 18 months of not seeing each other. But all I can think about is that this will never end and I will be back in lockdown in October. Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'. I haven't felt true, unconditional joy since maybe August last year. This past year of isolation broke me completely and I feel like I will never be happy again. I hadn't been on antidepressants since 2019 and now I lost all my progress. I feel so guilty because my family and friends are all so excited and proud of me but I feel empty, scared and sad all the time. I just wish this never happened.",

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish. Support and advice appreciated - thanks y'all",

        "situation": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.",

Things in Colorado have pretty much all opened up again and to be honest, Im back to living my normal life again and it has been glorious and has done wonders to my mental health. I followed the covid rules pretty hard before I got my vaccines (moderna both shots back in March and April) and ever since the CDC gave updated guidance to vaccinated individuals Im basically back to my pre pandemic life. This delta variant has me concerned and confused. Do the vaccines fucking work against it or not? Do you think we will be back on full lockdown in the fall/winter? Will this ever end? I hate everything about the covid lockdown lifestyle but Im a rule follower so Im gonna comply if need be but this ongoing cycle is breaking my will to live.",

With that said, Im now seeing more and more reports (including this CNBC report: [url] saying that the new Delta variant will cause the country as a whole to have to reimplement mask and social distancing requirements, especially in states with lower vaccination rates. Consequently, Im feeling increasingly worried that Ill come back in August only to find its gone back to not being safe to see anyone and classes have gone back to being mostly (if not completely) virtual, especially since my home state is one of those mUh FrEeDoMs states with low vaccination rates (granted, Im sure theyd be hesitant to require masks for the same reason, but a lack of that requirement doesnt change how safe or not safe things are). How likely do you think it will be that things will go back to being unsafe to see others when I go back in August (or later in the fall)? Is it reasonable to expect that things will end up needing to go back to being fully socially distanced?",

It's now clear that vaccines alone are not stopping the spread of this thing and vaccinated people are spreading. That means that in a few weeks this wave will be everywhere. I'm worried about kids who are 12 and below who aren't vaccinated. It will be impossible to have any schools open in the fall unless we risk long covid in kids which would be unimaginable. I'm worried about the African American population which is only 33% vaccinated. I'm worried bout breakthrough cases even though they're rare I worry about older people in my family and I know some immune compromised people who are going to be in trouble regardless. I understand the psychology of not wanting restrictions and lockdowns but it's clear that the pandemic isn't over we're entering a whole new stage of it and I hope that people follow the rules and don't risk their neighbors lives in the coming months due to selfishness and ignorance. I just wanted to say that",

I'm a 19 year old autistic Italian boy, but despite being on the spectrum right before the pandemic started I've had a big progress at socializing with people, I hung out with big groups among my friends every Saturday night, we had so much fun, and then the pandemic happened. My group not only shut down for months, but the general spirit of the group kept going downhill, i tried helping them but ended up feeling just as bad as them if not worse. After a painful year of online class (which i could barely even do cus my wifi had given up on me), I thankfully was able to get even both shots of the Moderna vaccine. But even after all that, the group hasn't changed. Whenever someone asks to go out, we get the same answers like \"i can't, i need to study/work\", \"I'll be there next weeks (it's the 4th time they said that) and the spirit is still doom and gloom. I want to find some other friends, but due to how stuck to their circles people are here I'm afraid I'll never be able to find someone else who likes me. What can i do which can help me? PS: Fyi, I've already tried online, I met many friends but I think physical contact is what I need, not seeing some messages",

Let's have a new \"operation warp speed\" and develop new drugs. Let's try antifibrotics to prevent lung fibrosis. Because I'm so tired of people saying \"vaccines prevent against hospitalization!\". I don't want to just avoid being hospitalized, I want to avoid permanent lung damage. People with mild or even asymptomatic covid are often left with permanent lung damage, but no one is talking about it. Do you want COPD and fibrosis lungs? I certainly don't. I'm moving to the UK soon and with tbe Delta variant raging I feel like a sitting duck. I'm so scared and hopeless because if I get Covid there's nothing I can do to save my lungs from fibrosing.

Then, a song came on that I used to listen to all the time before COVID hit and it suddenly hit me: a super strong feeling of sadness about losing my pre-pandemic self. I was 34 when COVID started and now Im 35, but I feel SO OLD. Like, covid aged me and I crossed a threshold from young adult to middle aged all of the sudden. I feel like any hope/positivity I had in the past is gone now and replaced by never ending existential dread. I have always been depressive, but it was about stuff that could be changed like my weight - not depression at an existential level. Its bigger than covid - once we get through this, society is gonna be permanently changed and I wouldnt be surprised if this results in either civil war in the US or some sort of world war. And climate change is gonna accelerate and were just going to let it happen and well all die. I dunno - I was aware of political instability and the gravity of climate change before covid... but neither was really a tangible and present threat like it feels like it is now. I guess I miss that sense of general security and ignorance. I miss that I could listen to music, spend time with friends/family, work - without constantly thinking whats the point?",

Before i was too terrified to even step foot outside my apartment for several months. After getting vaccinated (Pfizer) i feel like i was getting back to at least a version of myself last year where i wasn't so ocd about everything. I have even made plans to finally fly down my boyfriend to come visit me in my apartment at the start of August in a few weeks. Then this delta variant starts becoming the main thing in the news being reported about and i feel my fear setting in again. I still really want to see my boyfriend has he bought the tickets already and we made plans on how to be super safe while at the airport to the best of his ability. Im just still so terrified that somehow he will get a breakthrough infection despite being fully vaccinated (moderna) and masked up and somehow will be able to pass it on to me via breakthrough infection. To my knowledge cases are still pretty low and he lives in MN and coming to my state which is Georgia where we plan to get him as quickly as possible out of the airport come home and sanitize some things. Even with all the precautions we are taking im still worried that something might happen but i don't know if its my overwhelming covid anxiety or what. I just really want to make this trip still happen. I just want to ask what others would do in my situation.",

One person doesn't sound like a lot but really one person is worth it. I encourage everyone to think about someone in your life right now who is unvaccinated but just might need a steady hand to hold to get them down off the fence, and try for them, if you have the mental energy for it.

A friend will fly to visit two days after I got my second shot, and I am wondering how safe it is for me to meet with somebody shortly after getting my last dose? Will the vaccine already protect me at its full potential, or how much will it be? I have read all sorts of articles that say basically something between 30% and 90%??? This person will also get his second shot a few days before but is not as concerned as I am about it. He has contact with people at his job, and is basically going out and traveling again - wearing a mask and distancing ofc. I have been in isolation and wear a mask everywhere I go since the pandemic started. I am mostly concerned by long covid and other diseases that can be triggered by it. Thanks in advance!",

The reason I ask this? As much as I have done my part in wearing masks, I have grown weary of it, and I find them super uncomfortable to breathe in. Only time I would ever consider using them is in cold weather OR if I'm under the weather, but I'm at the point where I feel it is no longer necessary. Which is why I'm holding off on traveling until the mask mandate is gone. When I mentioned this on another subforum, others thought I was crazy and started pushing masks on me. I was offended that they weren't respecting my choice because I firmly feel uncomfortable traveling as long as the virus is around and as long as the mask mandate is on there. That's why I'm hoping that April 2022 will be a better time to travel to Florida than right now.",

        "situation": "Hi everyone, I thought I would post here to see if anyone has any words of advice/support. Ive been invited to a friends surprise hen-do in 1 month. Their maid of honour has rented a whole house for 3 days in a place 4 hours away. This would mean staying with approximately 12 other people, most who I dont know, not to mention sharing a bed and room etc. They have also planned lots of activities like paintball, laser tag, cocktail classes and dinners. Im feeling super anxious about the whole thing: 1. Because of Covid. I currently work in ICU, I caught Covid last year and had a real rough time recovering, and Ive barely gone out much except with close family. I am double vaccinated so that at least helps. At present, its actually against our guidelines to have so many people inside from different households, but this is meant to change at the end of July - unless cases continue to rise which they are. 2. Because of guilt if I decline and dont go, I dont want to let my friend down, I think she would probably stop inviting me places/to her wedding. And no one else in the group seems anxious over Covid, theyre all excited about going. I feel like if I say I cant go because of Covid, the group will all try and convince me it will be safe to go. I honestly dont know what to do, I know if I say I will go Im going to have so much anxiety all month leading up to it. I have to reply to the invite in the next few days. If anyone has been in this situation or has advice I would really appreciate it :)",

My experience with covid was bad, I got a heart inflammation (myocarditis) and it took me 5 months to recover and feel the same as I did before I got covid. My doctor recommended me to get at least one shot, so thats what I did. Its been 5 days since my biontech/Pfizer shot and i really feel awful. My arm still hurts and has a burning and tingling sensation and Im having headaches everyday since the shot. Today I woke up feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded. I also had chest tightness and went to the hospital where they took my blood and did an ECG and they told me that everything was fine, but the dizziness and the headaches kills me. I also do feel hot but I dont have a fever. I just want this to end and feel good again. Has anyone experienced the same and can anyone tell me if it gets better? Also to the women: has someone noticed changes in their menstrual cycle after getting the vaccine?",

        "situation": "i feel so frustrated, sad, and lost and i feel like i'm pretty close to spiraling. i've been trying to avoid social media / TV media as much as possible to stay away from the doom and gloom. i thought maybe i'd finally be able to travel (though safely, masks ok) and enjoy some things like amusement parks (off peak days for me!) Occasionally. maybe it wouldn't be full on \"pre-pandemic\" Era, but it would be better. now that ive seen the delta variant wrecking havoc on so many communities and countries, even those that are closer to full vaccination, i'm terrified and i've cancelled nearly all of my plans and have gone back to staying indoors as much as virtually possible, disinfecting everything, and working from home again. now i only leave the house for my pup's obedience classes and even then, i'm scared out of my mind. the other families aren't even masked. i live in a small community in TN , and though the majority of us are vaccinated, myself included (save for the kids below 12) i'm terrified. i've recovered from covid twice now and i'm horrified at what's happening. i never fully regained my sense of smell / taste properly - now everything smells at least slightly of rancid sewage (unless it's completely natural, think: fresh cut grass, some specific essential oils, plants etc) and i'm not even able to eat as well as i used to as a result. i don't want to have to do that again. never. but i'm so angry and uncomfortable, therapy isn't helping, it isn't solving what's actually happening i'm so tired of sleeping in tents and only ever doing nature hikes or local parks.. i miss the world. i miss cafes. i miss having friends. i miss beaches and traveling. i miss going out and doing literally anything that wasn't quiet window shopping or walking in some boring grass trails. i'm miserable ..",

I've been trying not to pay attention to it (but I haven't really been succeeding), but it IS alarming that there are cases rising in the Southern states. So far, the Upper East is not, but I do fear that there may be chances of us being blown back to square one and all the progress we've made so far being thrown out the window. I hope that doesn't happen, but based on how I've seen the cases climb lately (although today they WERE at 8k), I wonder if I'm overanalyzing this. I don't wanna go through the trauma all over again.",

Is it possible he'll feel fine in the morning? Sure.

        "situation": "I'm currently living at home with older parents and so I spent most of the pandemic prior to getting fully vaccinated chilling at home, getting take out, and having sporadic zoom calls with friends. Now that things are the way they are in the US, I've been trying to make an effort to see each of my friends at least once this summer, especially as I'll be moving across the country at the end of August. But these days, I've been finding myself completely wiped out after meeting up with one friend for 2-3 hours. As in... after I get home, I spend the rest of the day slowly building up the energy to even do minor errands around the house (but most of the time I just sink into the couch and stare at the TV for the rest of the day). I've also been purposely scheduling only one hangout every 3-4 days as my energy levels are only really better after that many days. Is this completely out of the ordinary? Pre-pandemic, I used to be able to handle seeing my coworkers every day, socializing and interacting with them throughout the day and at lunch, and would usually schedule dinner or a hangout with a friend every other day no problem. I feel so wrung out and tired after these hangouts, that I'm not even sure I've had fun by the end of them... I've tried to leave early a couple times too, but maybe my hints aren't strong enough, because I find that my friends don't say goodbye until I really emphasize that I have something to do at home. I think I was an outgoing introvert (if there's such a thing) pre-pandemic, but now, getting texts about hanging out just makes me anxious and preemptively tired. I want to just say no to 90% of these hangouts but I also feel guilty since I'm leaving and basically set hard limits on in-person hangouts prior to being vaccinated. &amp;#x200B; I don't even know what the purpose of this post is... but I just spent the last 6 hours recovering from a 3 hour hang out. Can anyone else relate?",

I've definitely been put through the ringer in the past year and a half - I lost my job which meant my right to live in the UK hung in the balance for a few months, and obviously didn't see any family or friends back home in the US. As of mid-June, I've been fully vaccinated so I flew back to the US to spend time with family during the month of July. I am really happy to see everyone I love, but I'm also experience immense anxiety. I think the thought of going back to normal, when it ISN'T normal and covid is still a threat, is causing me to spiral. It doesn't feel real to be back home, for one. Sometimes, it feels like I'm dissociating because somewhere that's so familiar feels foreign. I feel anxious and guilty about travelling with the variants circulating, and going out (despite the fact I avoid crowded areas and still wear masks indoors). It's setting off other anxieties as well, like intrusive thoughts of suddenly dying or dying early. There's no real point of this post I guess, I just wanted to say it and see if anyone felt similarly. I just had a breakdown and I'm so tired of feeling this way. All I want is to go back to London and be with my boyfriend to have that shred of safety that I felt throughout the pandemic.",

        "situation": "My mother started feeling unwell on Friday. She saw my sister and her two kids (sister is double vaccinated but the kids are too little still). Anyway. She had all the signs of covid, minus the cough and refuses to get tested. She says because she double vaccinated that she doesn't need to. When told that she should get tested because she travels for work she still refuses. I'm just blown away that she would refuse. I'm immune compromised. I can't get the shot right this moment because we aren't sure how I'm going to react (my heart and nervous system don't like things very much). And I just am so disappointed she won't do it to. She even bad a friend over on Sunday, while still feeling unwell. Then she went to the dump. I don't get it. Sorry if this is all jumbled and stuff. I am just tired of this shit. If you don't feel well and have the means to get tested. Do it. Here in Canada we can get tested any time we need for free (covered under our national health insurance plan) and it's not invasive. Sigh.",

If he hears that I went to a workout class or got a haircut indoors, he sighs deeply and tells me that Ive disappointed him. He also makes judgmental comments constantly to everyone for doing anything that involves going almost everywhere. This isnt too bad for me, because I moved out and live independently. But its really hard on my mom who lives with him. He gets mad at her for going on walks outside and constantly criticizes her. I worry very much about their mental health. Sometimes I think about standing up to him more, telling him he cant tell me what to do, but I know it probably wouldnt do any good. I know hes functioning out of anxiety. Does anyone have a relative that has become extremely (and unhealthily) judgmental and controlling, and if so, how do you cope with it?",

When the pandemic hit, I was a junior so the rest of my high school experience was in the pandemic. I, recently, graduated back in June (in person luckily). For a graduation present, my parents got tickets for Disneyland for my 3 friends (all fully vaccinated). My family and I have been very proactive when it comes to Covid related things. The reason for this is for my brother who has Down Syndrome. Sadly, he is still to young enough to get vaccinated but will be before the end of the year (thank god). Before being vaccinated, I was only able to see my friends in person only a handful of times since the start of the pandemic. Now things are (hopefully) going in a better direction in America and I am struggling to decide if I should wear a mask at Disneyland. It is surreal to even consider not wearing masks in general. I feel confused about information because the CDC says it is safe to do so but the WHO recommends masks for everyone regardless of vaccination status. I am so conflicted on what to do because, in a selfish way, I dont want to wear a mask because I just want to go back to normal. On the other hand, I would feel guilty if I got Covid and gave it to my unvaccinated brother. I am still weighing the pros and cons because I am healthy teenager but I know the Delta Variant is the most dangerous strains yet. I care so much about my brother and protecting others that I am scared I might make the wrong decision. What should I do?",

I live in a first world country, I have soo much to be thankful for. Good food, family, good uni. I do what I can to enjoy life, but a lot of my life is still taken up by hard work and anxiety things won't work out. My self confidence was destroyed long ago. I'm working on restoring it but yeahh, I'm afraid the world will go to shit and it'll feel like the hard work I put in won't be worth it.

For reference, I was a 2020 high school grad so I was one of the thousands who was robbed of an actual graduation, prom, senior activities, etc. Then my first year of college was also kinda sucky. First semester of my freshman year, I stayed home and did courses online because I was nervous about the virus and getting infected. Also wanted to protect people and being younger, I had a fear of spreading it to older people. Second semester of college, I actually moved on campus where I met a lot of friends and had fun. But I always wore my mask, hung out with a few friends who also always protected themselves, and never went to parties despite most of the student body going to these parties every week. School starts next month and things are pretty much back to normal. No masks required. Full stadiums. Sorority events in-person. All of it which Im super excited about. As the first person to go to college in my family, this was the college life I was so excited to live. Especially since college is such a short time experience and Im already 25% through with it. BUT I feel like COVID and the Delta variant (possibly the Lambda as well) will take that away from me again. So I have a fear of school shutting down later this fall and having another year ruined due to the variant and things just going in the wrong direction just like what happened to my senior year. But I also have a fear that Im being selfish by trying to have a normal year and just live life carefree, that would put people/the community in danger. How do I combat these fears mentally?",

She was up that night with a high fever and puking she told me yesterday. I knew it was gonna end up covid and told my employer I'd been exposed. The CDC doesnt require isolation for vaccinated people who have been exposed so I'm at work still with my mask on. I got the JnJ in March. I'm not sure how effective it is against the Delta variant as I hear it works, but am also seeing in my area there's been a lot of breakthrough cases for some reason. I was just reading an article yesterday about a weird outbreak among the vaccinated in the state above me where she lives. Just looking for some support or facts on whether I'm relatively safe or not. It'd be one thing if it was a brief exposure, but we spent 2 days together eating and drinking etc. I'm also worried about her as she has an autoimmune disorder and she woke up today with weird bruising.

So knowing my self and the fact that Im probably going to be lonely forever anyway I came up whit a very stupid plan to just hire an escort as soon as I was able too. Problem was it didnt stay whit that one time and honestly it didnt help at all but I kept feeling I had too and it seemed like my need for booze witch I acquired during the lockdown only increased. But now that Ive completely ruined what could have been I was going to try sober and give up someone till the clubs open back up again but honestly Im just afraid that if I do find someone right now Ill be in the same situation again whit the delta variant . And the whole delta variant makes me want to continue doing stupid shit knowing another lockdown might put me back at square one. Why the did I have too fall in love during a global pandemic? Just why?",

I trust scientists *way* more than I do politicians or anyone like that. But, I must admit, Im nervous as hell about getting my vaccination. Im not worried about what is in the vaccines, I know whats in them, they seem relatively safe. Im not overly worried about the side effects because they are mild in most cases. My family are all vaccinated and they are all completely fine. Here is where my anxiety comes from. Im scared of what these vaccines could maybe, *maybe*, end up causing in the future. According to my own research on the subject, Vaccines cant really cause things like cancer or anything. But, there is no guarantee that the vaccines wont cause a different serious illness. Im insanely conflicted. This new delta variant is honestly terrifying me, people younger than me are dying because of it, and Im only 18! I want to get vaccinated, I really do, I want protection from this horrific virus but Im really nervous. Id just like some support, maybe somebody more knowledgeable on the subject could help put my anxieties to rest. Thank you in advance.",

I was hopeful to be able to maybe start and go do small things like outdoor farmers markets (with my child) or even possibly to go into a store (haven't been since before lockdown). With restrictions lifted, it makes the world seem a lot scarier for me to bring my child out there. He hasn't been able to tolerate a mask due to sensory issues - so we have only been to essential dr appointments. Lately, even things like having maintenance or contractors come into my apartment to fix long standing overdue issues seems too hard and I'm avoiding it because my child is unvaccinated and they technically don't have to wear masks inside my apartment I guess. How are those of you with kids navigating all of this? We haven't gotten take out or been in a store this entire time and I know I need to somehow ease back into life and existence because maintaining this level of isolation is really starting to damage my mental health to the point where I don't even know how to interact in the world anymore. We drove past a busy ice cream place a few nights ago and instead of thinking about stopping and enjoying life - I cried. Seeing everyone without masks, close together, kids everywhere - and knowing my little kid isn't protected is so hard. It sends me into a full panic and I feel left behind in this scary place where I have lost all sense of what's safe, what's not and no idea how to move ahead while life just keeps going past and we sit in the same spot. My child has missed out on absolutely everything and I want him to have some normalcy, but I also want to be responsible and limit his exposure as much as possible. Other parents seem ok to travel and be out and about with their kids and I am just totally afraid to do the smallest things.",

        "situation": "I have been beaten up by mods for posting in the wrong subs, so I'm hoping this one is the right place! I have a weekend trip planned with a friend that I haven't seen in almost 2 years. I'm traveling from Seattle, WA and going to Spokane, WA. On day 1 we planned to stay at her place, and on day 2 we planned to stay in downtown Spokane and share a hotel room. I assumed she was vaccinated and agreed to these plans weeks ago. Once plans were settled I made sure to confirm vaccination status between us and she said that she is NOT vaccinated. I'm not entirely sure how safe it is to be around someone indoors and outdoors when they're unvaccinated. I'd also like to mention that my boyfriend has cystic fibrosis (hes vaccinated) and I'm worried about coming home and figuring out what precautions I need to take for that. Unvaccinated individuals in Washington state all have to wear masks in public, and while vaccinated individuals don't, the CDC website doesn't really go into broad descriptions on my specific concerns in their FAQ's section. Is it completely unreasonable to avoid staying at her place, and that I get my own separate hotel room? Will she need to continue to wear a mask around me while we're indoors hanging out, or in the car?? How should we proceed with hanging out outside?",

Also adapting to a different normal and reading news all day made an impact. Is anyone else experiencing anything similar?",

From what it looks like Los Angeles has not yet completed its round of vaccinations. There are still Latinos and others who have yet to receive the shot. L.A. isn't where it needs to be just yet. So of course the restrictions are coming back. That said, does this mean the same thing will happen everywhere in the United States? No. There are other regions that are highly vaccinated where such mandates will probably not be necessary. Aside from Los Angeles, where else in California have masks been mandated? That said if you are vaccinated, you are still well protected. And better yet, if you live in a region where the virus is not circulating, then of course it's safe to take off your mask. Highland Park in NJ is one such place. NJ is also one of the highly vaccinated states, so it's not facing much danger. Once again, this is just UNVACCINATED people. Does it mean these restrictions are going to be forever and that we'll never get our lives back? Does it mean we'll have to live like this forever? No and no. And a thousand times no. Fact: the children's vaccine is coming for September. Remember? THAT is another pocket of unvaccinated people who need to take the shot. Only then can we start to make anymore dents. That said, if you live in Los Angeles County, I understand how you feel. It IS heartbreaking, and it's unfortunate it's come down to this. But simultaneously, it's just a reminder that more people have to be vaccinated over there. And I'm sorry you have to go through this. But once again, we will NOT have to do this forever. There is still a good chance that this will all be over by the end of the year. Do not -- I repeat, DO NOT -- give up hope. This WILL end.",

It's one big room and they only have 2-3 staff present with not more than three patients at a time. Okay, that's all fine and dandy, but today I walked in and they're finishing up with a new patient who is wearing his mask under his nose. My first thought is just the usual eye roll and judgements about people who behave this way. Then I come to terms with the fact that they were treating him and allowing this behavior, which IMO makes their mask policy complete BS. So, here's the thing, I'm vaccinated but I have a medically at-risk kid who is too young to get jabbed. Delta spread is high in our county and from what I've read, it might be more transmittable even by vaccinated people. I'm about halfway through my expected treatment and seeing good progress. I also really like my therapist. But, honestly I 'm feeling like I don't want to step foot back in that place. I'm torn between just cancelling the rest of my appointments or how I might confront them about the issue?",

The results from the trial for kids 5-11 are not going to be until September. Waiting an additional 4 months after that would be absolutely disastrous for both children AND schools. Considering that some schools are not requiring mask mandates I fear the consequences will be stiff. That's why I would prefer for the vaccine to come out sooner than that so that we do not have disasters like this happen. As someone who works with kids, I am very, very concerned about this and do not want to see children continue to be deprived of this vaccine for any longer than necessary.",

Is the Delta Variant a problem, yes. But only for unvaccinated. That's all. They also said masking is only advisable in areas where there are low vaccination rates, not high ones. As disappointing as it is about L.A., keep in mind that this is on account of half the population not being highly vaccinated. So while they didn't say anything we didn't already know, they are still using calming rhetoric. Which isn't to say you should drop your guard in an unvaccinated area. There's a reason for that. But having said that, they ARE working at trying to get more people vaccinated. The Delta Variant is NOT a reset presser, just another obstacle. But it IS one that CAN be overcome with more vaccinations. The more we do so the better. So try not to obsess too much about this if you're vaccinated and continue to live your life. Don't panic so much, keep in mind, we will still be able to crush this virus and end the pandemic. Nobody should lose faith now.",

So my sister doesn't really believe in Covid and thinks it's all a part of a bigger agenda. Let me point out that she does believe it exists but just doesn't 'believe' it is as bad as it is, this is all due to her ex-boyfriend who is an total anti-vaxxer and just an as\\*hole in general (but that's just IMO). My mother also questions covid a lot, she does 'believe' it exists as well, she's not entirely against all the measurements (apart from a few obvious ridiculous ones we have to deal with here in Southern Spain) however my sister convinced her to also not take the vaccine (my mother is 63). On another side note, my father does 'believe' it all and even got his 2nd second as of 2 weeks ago. I'm literally in between as I dont know what to do with them or how to approach them regarding vaccination as I think it IS necessary and I would like to get my vaccine (I haven't been called yet), have any of you experienced something similar? If so, any suggestions on how to approach this? Please, feel free to ask me anything! Thanks in advance!",

I really don't want that to happen, it would feel like falling just before the finish of a marathon. However, I can't just lock myself up for 3 weeks, because I have my lil' job as a postwoman. Even if I could just stay home, I live with my dear SO who wouldn't agree with being locked up, and I get that, it'd be extreme. Also, I've been hearing someone who lives above or next to us (I'm not sure) coughing horribly this whole day. Every time I hear it my mind becomes anxious. It's such a nasty cough and it makes me think about covid immediately :(( It comes so close this way, eventhough there's a wall - luckily!",

I am fully vaccinated, but I WAS still a little scared because there were others in the theater and they were not masked. Even though I had been told again and again I did not need to mask up indoors in NJ, I did anyway because I was scared. Only on occasion did I take it off to breathe a few times, but when I heard some people cough or sneeze, I put it back on to protect myself. It had been a long time since I saw myself in the company of people in an indoor place unmasked. And this is in one of the most highly vaccinated places in NJ. When I got home, one of my neighbors actually laid into me for taking my mask off at times, saying that she would have preferred it if I wore it indoors all the time. I couldn't blame her for being concerned, but I was still left feeling worried by that. I wondered if I had made a mistake in going to see the movie, especially in alternating between taking it off and on. For all I know I could end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it. I know I shouldn't be this nervous and scared, but the recent news of the Delta HAD shaken me somewhat and I am worried that I might end up catching the virus with the reports I'm hearing of people taking the vaccine getting sick from the virus still. I'm sorry I sound like I'm such a mess, but I felt scared throughout and I wanted to have some opinions on whether I put myself in danger or not.",

The CDC is disgraceful for only counting breakthrough cases that result in hospitalization or death, and not actual cases. They dont realize that even mild or asymptotic cases can still have a negative effect on ones body. I really think we need to do more research on just how many breakthrough cases there are after full vaccination. I know vaccines arent 100% and they never will be, but infection shouldnt be very common either, otherwise we are clearly seeing waning immunity or resistance to variants, and boosters should be looked into. I personally am worried about breakthrough cases, even mild ones, since I dont want to have a loss of taste and smell or even long covid. It has not yet been proven definitively if vaccines prevent long covid should you come into contact with covid 19 after vaccination. I feel like they should have waited to make the vaccines, if they could have, until they knew more about the virus, but we couldnt wait due to dramatic loss of life. Even still, Im happy they approved the vaccines so quickly.",

I couldn't travel for the funeral because, well, pandemic. I booked a hotel for the end of July because I figured we'd all be vaccinated by then and it'd be reasonably safe to travel. My mom needs help dealing with my dad's stuff, and I want to pick out some mementos of my favorite parent. I think I was wrong. I'm vaccinated (Pfizer) and my mother and sibling are, too (moderna+natural immunity). The rest of Kentucky is sucking at vaccination. Where I live: [2.6 daily new cases per 100k people, 64% at least partially vaccinated]([url] Where they are: [16 new cases daily per 100k people. 39% at least partially vaccinated]([url] The plan is to drive 15 hours, stay in a hotel, and cook in the room or get takeout. Masks with filters, hand sanitizer obsessively. Avoid my partner for a week once I get back, masking whenever in common areas. If anyone gives me grief about masking, just tell them \"Hi, for context: I'm halfway through a 16-hour roadtrip to help my mom pick out my dad's headstone. What was it you needed to tell me?\" (I'm autistic. Scripts are good.) Is this too risky? I can still cancel the hotel and rebook later. Antsy skippable backstory: I totally blame my mom for killing my dad. She brought Covid home after attending a \"mandatory work Christmas breakfast party\". My dad was definitely vulnerable to the disease, having a history of heart problems. I'm still very very upset and pissed at her. She's a narcissist that's been playing the \"grieving widow\" card since before my dad died. While he was in a coma, she whined to me that dating as a widow is such a balancing act: date too soon and people judge you for it. Date too late and people think you're just so sad. Anyway, lots of emotions. Thanks in advance for your advice.",

        "situation": "I spent pretty much all of 2020 freaked out over the virus to the point of chaos. I thought that I would get some peace when I got the vaccine (as did all the people I generally come in contact with at any great length) and could stop worrying so much. But then they start talking about breakthrough infections or people who are immuno-suppressed not as protected. Not sure where that leaves me as I have no spleen. I do get plenty of white blood cells when I have some issue, but don't know if that is the same as a broken immune system as it relates to COVID. No one seems to have a straight answer, although I do know there are studies working on that question. On top of that, my housemate, who is vaccinated as well, got a new job at a popular restaurant in town that apparently doesn't have any mask requirements. They didn't even ask if she'd been vaccinated, which means that they probably hire those that aren't. She is excited for the job, but I'm worried that she'll pick up the delta variant as now they say that even casual encounters can get someone infected. And I'm worried that she'll bring home the virus and I'll be compromised, even though I hope neither of us would wind up sick enough to be hospitalized or die. Not to mention going to Walmart was like a nightmare this morning. I was wearing a mask, but it seemed like I was one of the few. Our county is only 27% vaccinated and yet 90% of the people there had no masks because since they lifted the mask requirements, everybody's honor seems to have gone awry. I almost had a panic attack when a guy without a mask coughed near me and the guy got too close. I hate having to be scared of the idea that someone's breath could be like a bullet to the brain, only more agonizing. I'm currently seeing a therapist for mental issues, but I just don't see how this is ever going to end for me where I can get back to a peaceful \"normal.\" Sorry, just venting a bit...",

I also believe most of the students/staff will be fully vaccinated. At the same time, Im still wary about traveling in general and indoor events, particularly with the Delta variant going around. Im hoping that if conditions worsen, the law school will move the event online, but I dont feel like I can count on it. Ive had some ongoing health issues post-COVID, so Im fearful of getting infected again, even with a mild case. Id appreciate any advice on what I should do or how to make my decision.",

        "situation": "So, long story short, I am in the US to get a vaccine. I'm not living here and I have a small window of time. Got my first shot, my next one is a little over a week away. After that I have just enough time to let it kick in (to be honest, a couple days short, I messed up my flights a bit) before I fly out again. My luck has been horrific for this whole pandemic though, and of course I can't count on anything going well, so I'm unsurprised that I have managed to crack an entire molar and I need to get it looked at urgently. In spite of being pretty good about my dental hygiene in the past, I've put off my annual dentist check ups for two years because of this shitty pandemic. I kind of have to do something about this, but I'm scared. Rationally I know I have some protection nearly two weeks out from my first jab, and there's a strong chance that the dentists I see here would all have been vaccinated ages ago. I guess I could try to push it off even longer, but when I return to my home country, I'm going to a place where there are way less vaccinations that have been distributed, so I think I'd be more nervous. My luck isn't great and this year has been super hard, I just don't want it to get worse if I can help it at all. Most other doctors visits wouldn't be as scary because I could mask up accordingly... but this is mentally tricky, it's the one thing where I suddenly have to have my mouth wide open around a bunch of strangers for an unknown procedure. My partner is encouraging me to just go now, even though I'm waiting for my second shot, because it's really not great to have this. So, I'm bracing myself, because I think my partner is correct, but my anxiety is firing on all cylinders. Does anyone have some reassurance around going and getting dental work done? Words of encouragement? Has anyone had to go do some emergency dental work during the pandemic?",

I have two shots and Im living my life and seeing friends and the like but I also have this nagging feeling come September its all going to come crashing down. Now experts in Canada have been saying FOURTH WAVE IS COMING!!! DONT GET TOO COMFORTABLE IN THE REOPENING.... and it just depresses me to no end. This dark cloud just wont go away. &amp;#x200B; Deep inside this ordeal has broken my ability to feel positive about anything in life. I fear after this a brand new global calamity will take hold and pile up constantly. Im only 27 years old and I really wanted to enjoy my life but I feel as if the best of days are not coming back. Sometimes I wish I was born much earlier to where id have enjoyed more of my life rather than coming to this young age and being stuck in this constant state of fear. I know its partially the anxiety and depression talking but I cant help it. I guess I feel like things are on the downward slope all over. &amp;#x200B; I fear ever bringing children into this world as I dont know if its going to be a good life for them or a hellish dystopia.",

Me and 2 of my best friends saw each other a week ago. One friend slowly became sick ovee the course of the weekend. Tested positive Monday. My other friend and I who I live with immediately started isolating, informed my work and they told me to keep coming in. Around Wednesday friend started showing symptoms, we both got tests Thursday and results yesterday. He was positive I was negative so he went into isolation in his room. This morning I woke up with aches and took my temp and it was higher than normal 100.9. Not too bad but am fairly certain it means I have covid. They've both lost their senses of taste, the first friend had more symptoms she had a high fever and was puking, fatigued, says today it's hard to breathe but she's fine otherwise. Friend I live with has a cough qnd headaches and congestion but energy is fine. I turn 30 in 2 days, the whole thing just sucks. If it's rare how did we all get it? We've all been fully vaxxed for a couple months. I feel like I just never understand what's happening even though I'm constantly reading about it. Just venting I guess",

Or even guidelines. Because the people saying \"lock down until COVID is gone\" -- that will never happen, ever. And then there's people saying \"lock down until a certain % are vaccinated\" but here in America we've basically hit the ceiling. Anyone who wanted to be vaccinated has been vaccinated. Now what? Literally everyone around me has expressed how awful the past year and a half has been. Teenagers who have fallen into a depression and lost all their social skills, kids who lost their precious childhood years, adults who are overwhelmed with zero outside support, the elderly in nursing homes where they can't be visited. It's like everything fun has been zapped out of life and you get called selfish if you say that a year and a half of this with no clear end in sight is overwhelming.",

        "situation": "My wife and I both work in an assisted living facility and have taken covid and the precautions very seriously from the start. We been fully vaccinated since February. Our son on the other hand is only 4, and can't get vaccinated. We know the risk to him is low and that he's very likely to be fine if he does get it. We've been seeing our immediate family members and close friends who are all vaccinated, but we've stayed away from everyone we know who isn't vaccinated. The issue were having is that the majority of both of our families are anti-covid vaccine and anti mask. One of our friends in our usual group is anti-covid vaccine and anti mask. Most of them, especially the ones that want to see us, acted like covid didn't exist and were out all the time. These people now want to see us, or are being invited to all the functions so the only way to avoid them is to not go. My MIL, and some of our other vaccinated friends are giving us a hard time and making us feel like we're being ridiculous by not seeing our unvaccinated family and friends. So my question is are we being ridiculous? Are we being overly cautious when we shouldn't be? Because a lot of people are making us feel like we are. We know the chances of him getting really sick are low, but also realize that the people who want to see us/him are not taking any precautions and seeing a ton of other non-vax people. They also are the type of people that won't work with us by taking precautions themselves. Tl;Dr- Wife and I are vaccinated, 4 year old isn't. Unvaccinated family/friends want us to hang out with them with our son. Are we being ridiculous by not wanting to take our son around anti-covid vaxers who also don't wear masks and go out all the time and hang out with a ton of other anti-vaxers?",

Two of my grandparents passed on for non-COVID reasons, the third ended up getting COVID from a friend (my grandmother thankfully lived, but the friend she got it from sadly didnt), COVID isolation resulted in me having to stay at my parents house 24/7 for months (I love my parents, but this really didnt work well for any of us, especially with everyones stress levels being so high), I almost never saw or even talked with friends (the latter mostly being because the virtual conversations we did have wouldnt last due to there being nothing to talk about), and my anxiety and depression had gotten so bad that I was regularly thinking about killing myself. Ive since pursued counseling for my anxiety and depression, and this combined with the pandemic situation getting better has helped a ton with my mental health issues. However, now theyre saying this Delta variant is going to make things bad again, and it almost feels like were going to end up back at square one again (even as someone who is fully vaccinated again). I genuinely dont know if I could do all of this again. I barely made it through the first time; I dont know if I could make it through the second (especially right after the first). I dont know what Im looking for from this maybe reassurance? Because honestly at this point Im terrified.",

I got the Moderna vaccine back around March/April (that's when both of my shots were, I've been fully vaccinated since May). I didnt go on the coronavirus subreddit for a while because I'm like \"Im fully vaccinated, dont need to go on it anymore!\", I randomly went on the subreddit one day, and I've been back on it ever since (usually go in the daily discussion thread). I've been reading about the breakthrough cases with Delta and it's making me a little nervous than I was about a month or so ago. Especially since I am in Florida where cases or more or less on the rise. I know the vaccines arent 100% effective, but It just makes me very nervous to be going on a plane knowing that the Delta Variant is spreading. Luckily if I were to get it, my mom and everyone around me is vaccinated, so that helps. But, I watched a Tik Tok Video of someone saying that they caught a covid breakthrough case, and I keep reading stuff on Reddit about covid breakthrough cases, and my mom is watching like CNN and well it's CNN. Should I honestly be that concerned about becoming a breakthrough case?",

        "situation": "Aaron Astor has made an interesting discovery on the Delta Variant, according to his Twitter. According to graphs in Scotland, the variant may hit hard and fast, but it ultimately doesn't do as bad a damage as other variants. In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy. That's attributed to how much vaccinations we have made. The more people we do this to, the better. I hope I am not giving any false hopes, but this post DID have me intrigued.",

        "situation": "Like a lot of you Ive been stressing a lot about the possibility of breakthrough infections to Covid. Anyway I saw this article today on NBC news as website and believe it or not it makes me feel a whole lot better. According to this article 27 states have kept monitoring their number of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations have started. According to this the totals are around 65,000, though to be fair thats not accurate since more than likely theres many more of those other 23 states so for the sake of argument lets assume that all of those other states have the exact same amount so will make our maximum amount 130,000. Then we extrapolate that against the 160 MILLION who are fully vaccinated. That means that statistically 99.92% of people with full vaccinations have not gotten breakthrough infections. Peopletake a sigh of relief. We gonna be fine. [url]",

The funeral in on July 30. There will be a large group lunch at someone's home after the funeral. We will wear a masks and try to be outside at the lunch if we can. But I have a week vacation to Bonaire planned, flying on August 7 and August 14. I will need a negative PCR test within 72 hours before both flights. The trip would be cancelled or we could not fly back on schedule and would be quarantined in Bonaire for a while. We are both fully vaccinated with Pfizer. We have trip insurance and good international medical health insurance. But we would hate to have to cancel the trip due to a positive PCR test. Seems like a positive PCR tests may be quite a bit more likely that a symptomatic case of Covid19. I don't have a good feel for the risk. Is it less than 1%? I am trying to figure out the risk of ending up with a positive PCR for these flights. Thanks for any input.",

I was hoping to gain as much insight from other people as I can to ensure that my health and safety isn't compromised. I've always been afraid of vaccines and doctors (I still usually ended up getting them) but then I also am afraid of getting sick so I've been doing my absolute best to stay healthy and unvaccinated until I am sure. The only vaccine that I seem to trust is the Novavax vaccine which is not available to the public in the U.S yet but I was wondering if I should take the risk of getting a different vaccine because I really do want to get back to my normal life. My main concern about these vaccines would have to be the side effects and ingredients listed on them. Majority of my peers tell me they have been experiencing heart problems ever since they got the vaccine which terrifies me and I am also scared for them! I know they say the risk is so small but I don't want to be added to that number. They literally recommended me not to get vaccinated, and then the people online call me an idiot because I am not. As far as I know, the Novavax does not have any severe side effects like the ones I heard about in the others. Can someone provide me their insight about this? What are your thoughts?",

Every hospital/ clinic i have seen in the past is hiding from me that i have a mass in my head and neck so im pretty sure i have cancer by now. its been about 10 years since a receptionist snuck me the paper that said one of my active conditions is a mass in my head and neck. My question is. Is it illegal to hide a diagnosis froma patient that is life threatening. I Thank you for reading.really need to know if this is legal.",

However, he woke up around 3am feeling feverish. Feverish feeling went away but hes been sneezy today. I just have a scratchy throat, but I always have a scratchy throat due to allergies and living in Austin. Today I found out that one of the people we met up with on Friday tested positive thru antigen test but they feel like they just have allergies. So multiple exposures we probably have covid. What would be the point in getting tested? Mask mandates were finally lifted at my office but Im putting mine back on just to protect others. Im just feeling so discouraged about our future as a society. I want people to feel safe again. But all of this makes it seem like the vaccines dont work. We are also having our postponed wedding ceremony in October. We postponed from this May because we wanted people to ease back into normalcy and we werent sure people would have access to the vaccines! Doubt anyone will be excited to come now.",

Rather than inform employees, management/HR did all they could to keep new cases under wraps, so those who were in contact were not made aware of the risk. This obviously blew up in their face and there was no one to work for 2 months. There was never even any formal acknowledgement let alone apology for this incredible lapse in judgement. And Steve doesn't believe there was ever any sort of investigation into the event, if that's a thing. Since then there has been significant turnover, with many new people who presumably have not yet been infected. Well apparently it's happening AGAIN, and the only reason any employees are aware are from sharing info with each other. Admin makes no effort to reach out to those working in proximity to others who may be sick, and are giving no explanation for why certain employees are mysteriously gone, not even to managers of said employees. It's complete lunacy, and Steve has no idea what to do. He fears inaction, if not retaliation if talking directly to management. Is there some organization that he can report this to? To protect himself and other workers? This is in SoCal btw. Please let me know if I can provide more information, I was trying to crank this out as fast as I could. Thank you...",

I'm really sorry to say this, because I'm sounding like an asshole now and I've already got some psychological problems I need to work on, but sometimes I wish for something like a personality disorder that can be used as a superpower where I don't even realize what's surrounding me (to not feel shitty), but still can take part in socializing, doing things useful for my career,... Where I'm from they dropped the mask mandate for shopping under 7-day-case-rates of 10 and I'm also more and more surrounded by people who flaunt masks and precautions when needed/mandated- I feel as if it's already useless to argue with them. I suffer from pandemic fatigue more and more and I don't feel as if my behavior would benefit anyone anymore. I'm not one of those people who never cared - I cared for the last 1.5 years. But the longer it goes, my solidarity decreases. Then add the fact that I'm vaccinated already, but recently I'm more and more reading bad news regarding Delta vs the vaccines. It feels like an endless fight and one I don't want to fight anymore. The vaccinations were the promised goal, now it seems that we have unlocked another shitty COVID sequel - fucking Delta.",

I'm not a social butterfly by any means and have had social anxiety in the past, but I was just starting to enjoying being around people, socializing after work etc pre-COVID. Now myself and colleagues (1000+) have been told that on return, we can come into the office and work, but all teams will be mixed together, and most people will be working from home - probably just a few. This means that I'll be working with a handful of people (who I don't work directly and do different roles completely). What makes me feel worse is that most people don't want to return to work. They have families, friends and good home lives which means not going into an office is no great loss to them. But for me, it *was* my social life. I know I shouldn't be complaining, I have a job, I've not got COVID and I'm surviving. But it makes me depressed and I guess I'm just mourning the loss of the trajectory my life was going pre-COVID",

I can't just go and tell people it's over and you'll never have to worry again, not when I don't think those are the facts.

My perspective is that this is a serious crisis, but we are smart and strong and we can get through it. I want to offer realistic ideas about what the future will look like and useful tips to help people get through it. It bothers me that people seem to want me to say, \"Nothing bad will happen, you are perfectly safe, you can guarantee the safety of everyone around you, the pandemic will never hurt you,\" or, \"No, you'll never have to miss an event or wear a mask again,\" because those things just aren't true. They're comforting in the moment, but they only set you up for disappointment. I would prefer to say, \"You've been keeping yourself safer this way and this other way,\" or, \"Your mask might help keep your town from needing a lockdown,\" or, \"There are safer ways to socialize so you don't have to stay away from your friends.\" Maybe I don't get it, but isn't support supposed to be realistic? I would hate to be lied to. Always did, even as a little kid. Like, I wanted to know that the shot would hurt but that it wouldn't last long or be very painful; I didn't want to be lied to and told it wouldn't hurt a bit, and then feel betrayed when it did.",

My mother and sister refuse to get vaccinated, and my sister refuses to get her kids vaccinated (they are teens). They are all gathering, with other family members (some vaccinated some not) for a belated wake, and I made the decision not to go. In March of 2020, my husband and I had to decide not to travel when his father passed, because the risk of spreading covid to his mother/family was too great. Even though we are vaccinated now, too many of my family have chosen not to get vaccinated, and for the same reasons we held in March 2020, I dont want to either potentially transmit the delta variant to my mother, or be exposed to it- in the event my Pfizer vaccine is in need of a booster. My mother, of course does not understand my decision and cries every day when I talk to her. So of course I feel incredibly guilty, and also angry that my family is being insane. It feels like a crack in the foundation of our relationship is gaping open. I have no idea how to fix it or cope, and I just needed to vent, so thank you.",

In a small, enclosed space there are a few barbers, the people getting a haircut and a few people waiting.

I realize times have changed and for now, masks aren't required, but that puts me pretty far out of my comfort zone with COVID....and it's been a struggle. I just don't want to bring something home to my kids. Is this just one of those things where you go for it and trust the vaccine will be ok?

He has/had more symptoms than me (poor guy ) but thankfully no loss of taste or smell yet. So my husband has a cold. It is clear that this delta variant is incredibly contagious but maybe not as strenuous to the healthcare system? After two to three months of normalcy, I fear that as a society, we will regress into our pre-vaccinated behavior. I dont know if that is the right move. How will we ever know if we need updated vaccines if we are all wearing masks again? Obviously children and immunocompromised need to take more precautions, but this is all feeling like two steps back. And please dont tell me that at least the death toll and hospitalization rates arent skyrocketing at the same rate. I am worried about our collective societys mental health. My friends that I have spoken to that recently tested positive and have mild symptoms despite being vaccinated are feeling betrayed by the vaccine. I dont think we should be feeling this way. I also understand a big source of anger is that so many unvaccinated people caused this spike. I feel like this argument is so futile because shouldnt have this been part of the equation or formula making? The constraint being that we were never going to convince 100% of the population to get vaxxed? Thanks in advance.",

I got J&amp;J because it was the only one available to me, I was otherwise in the country's absolute last age group for adults getting vaccinated and it kept getting delayed again and again, so I was desperate for a vaccine so I could have a chance at finally seeing my family in the UK again (I live in Denmark). Since finding out my dad has cancer this became even more pressing. But now I am hearing that we are recommended to get a booster of pfizer or moderna, I literally feel nauseous. Like everything is backsliding. Since J&amp;J and Astra Zeneca were dropped from the vaccine program here and given to a private company, those of us who received them are not on the regular vaccine plan anymore. At least not for this round, nothing has been planned for booster shots yet. So I can't just go and book a different shot. I already am terrified of my dad dying, especially dying after I have not seen him in over a year and a half. I also have elderly grandparents, my grandad is 91, who knows how long he has left? Now I am terrified this news will lead to J&amp;J being considered invalid in the EU and/or UK, I am already being kept away right now due to the UK only allowing people vaccinated inside the UK to non have to quarantine 10 days (but they allow nightclubs to be open?? \"Freedom day\" is also terrifying me), now even if that gets lifted I might still be screwed. This just feels like it is never going to end, and I feel with how so much of the world still has no access to vaccines we're going to get more and more variants that destroy our progress for getting some normalcy back.",

Knew I probably shouldn't go but I knew I was vaccinated so I thought I'd be fine. Fast forward to Sunday evening and im getting some fatigue/body aches and a scratchy throat. I've been dealing with some chronic acid reflux &amp; asthma stuff since March 2020 and have had spells of scratchy throats and body aches before so I figured it was just another one of those popping up. They usually went away in a day or two. The thought of going to the wrestling show was still in the back of my mind though. By Monday night I had a cough and congested sinuses. So finally this morning I got up and did a rapid test and sure enough it came back positive. Told everyone I went to the show with and everyone I'd seen since (including my parents ugh) and all got tested today or are getting tested tomorrow. Most from today have come back negative thankfully. So now im just sitting here with a sore throat, cough, stuffy nose and sinus headache crossing my fingers that it doesn't get any worse and that I didn't end up infecting my parents. Any other recovered breakthroughers on here? How long after the onset of your symptoms did it take to get better? \\--- Since writing this yesterday I've started to have some trouble breathing and 2 instances of coughing up white mucus. Still no fever and I have a pulse oximiter and my oxygen has been bouncing mostly between 98 &amp; 99, but occasionally dropping to 97 - not super worried yet there. Hoping this is the worst of it but preparing for more.",

        "situation": "An argument I often hear with regards to our path towards herd immunity is that there could be natural immunity on top of vaccinations. And that as covid continues to spread among the unvaccinated, it would bring us closer to herd immunity through natural infections. However, whenever I see this argument, I start to doubt if natural immunity could actually be of any help. And this concern is due to one thing: variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5. Rinse and repeat It is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandemics end eventually, usually after a few years. It makes me worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people. Is there something missing from my logic here? [I have heard that viruses will eventually reach a point of \"peak fitness\"]([url] where it has evolved to optimal survival conditions. Maybe this is what will break the cycle?",

There's no wound, no skin conditions, or any external wound. It just feels like an ever-present dull pain that would worsen when touched. Even blowing air on my cheek can \"sting.\" Any help or resources are appreciated. Or anyone experiencing the same thing, please do share with me. Thank you so much!",

My husband and I are both double vaccinated but our children are not (all under 12). Unfortunately, my husbands grandmother passed away a couple days ago in another province and he is already talking about traveling for the service. We have been super careful through out the pandemic as I have an immune condition so curbside pick up, remote learning and distancing from our family and friends (with the exception of outdoor visits) has been our norm. While my husband would travel alone, this is a BIG change for us. He seems quite comfortable going-me not so much. I'm concerned about the delta variant. I've heard of several people testing positive despite being fully vaccinated. I'm especially worried about our kids because they have no protection at this point. How valid are my concerns? Can my husband still catch covid and bring it home to our family? Is there a way to do this safely? Our home is small and the chance of my husband quarantining from us after traveling is impossible. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if he held off on travel until our whole family was vaccinated but that doesn't appear to be an option. Any thoughts?",

In the middle of the night, he felt a bit feverish but it went away. Tuesday night, he felt about the same. But then yesterday, he basically got hit by a truck. His coughing and sneezing got worse. His fever peaked at 99F and it is still coming and going. He lost his sense of smell in the middle of the night, which crushes me. I dont even know what to do now. He is vaccinated and young but he doesnt take vitamins (now I am giving him 1000 mg of vit c, 4000 iu of vit, zinc, magnesium). His oxygen levels are still good. I surprisingly have tested negative and still feel pretty normal. Its only day 4 of symptoms but I just want to make sure I do everything right. I also just wish I could be near him and hug him.",

That said, I took the pandemic seriously since March 2020 and have continued to, even after being fully vaccinated as of April 2021. I havent eaten at a restaurant, havent seen friends, wear a mask wherever I go, still treat mail as though it can contain virus (even though theres research to show its unlikely to catch COVID from touching a surface). I know that even if I did get COVID, it would be mild since Im vaccinated. Still, I cant help but continue to be anxious, especially with the probably third wave were entering in the US. I feel like on one hand I should loosen up - see vaccinated friends/family, for example - and accept the risk of getting sick with a mild illness. But the other part of me feels like I just dont want to ever get COVID, period. A lot of my friends and family have been giving me a hard time for not seeing them, so I feel like Im just being crazy/paranoid.

Just a background: I'm NOT an anti-vaxxer but these are the circumstances that force me to ask myself this question. I got my first dose of a vaccine last month. The vaccination site was very unsafe and I ended up getting infected from there. Having COVID has honestly traumatised me and it's made me very confused on what to do. The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused. Please do let me know your thoughts but be kind and understanding. Thank you.",

I wanted to believe it would have ended and that the event would be a symbol of hope in a COVID-free world. Turns out... yeah, it hasn't yet. It certainly is a lot weaker in many countries, but not here. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread while watching the ceremony. The thought of a neverending epidemic and endless pseudo-normalcy hadn't crossed my mind in so long, and it came back today. Those thoughts fueled my suicidal urges for months last year. It seemed less painful to just die than to wait for a future that didn't seem to ever arrive. Seeing that stadium still empty, after months of convincing myself everything would already be okay by now, definetely did not help. I don't know. I guess I'm just sad.",

I am a Mexican citizen studying in France. While in France, some months ago I got vaccinated with Moderna, yet they only allowed me to get 1 dose since I had covid in December and officially that's how it works there since they count the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated. Though honestly this left me a bit concerned since not all countries have this policy, as far as I know... I'm back in Mexico for the summer and vaccinations for the youth will begin next week in my city, offering Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Sputnik V and Sinovac. I'm considering on registering and taking my \"second dose\" here. Specially if it were Pfizer since I've read that mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet according to some studies. My parents say I shouldn't \"risk it\" since according to France I'm fully vaccinated already. But my girlfriend is immunosupressed and it's always a little scary being close to her since because of my work I am out on the street often and she needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. Can anyone help assessing me on making this choice? Thanks beforehand.",
